[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ae72f2c2cd3a414b9fe2f81e453749d8)](https://www.codacy.com/app/joesan/csv-parser?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=joesan/csv-parser&utm_campaign=badger)

A parser implementation for CSV files using the awesome Shapeless library

First clone the project
git clone https://github.com/joesan/csv-parser.git

To run the project and produce the jar file - 
sbt assembly

To run the jar file - 
java -cp target/scala-2.11/XXX.jar path.to.your.MainClass args(0)

I'm currently developing the parser, so if you would like to try it out, clone the project, import it into your favorite IDE

After importing, open the CSVParser.scala and scroll down to the bottom where you will see examples of how to run the parser!!
